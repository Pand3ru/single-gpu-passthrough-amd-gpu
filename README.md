# single-gpu-passthrough-amd-gpu
This is a guide for passing an AMD GPU to a Windows 10 Guest VM on Linux

There are several outstanding guides covering this topic and you should check them out first If you have no idea about single gpu passthrough.

I decided to make my own guide because all of the guides already available didn't work for me because they were mostly ment for Nvidia GPUs.
After 2 months of troubleshooting I was finally able to make this setup work and hopefully this will work for you too.
